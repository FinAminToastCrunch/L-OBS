Paper link: [Learning to Prune Deep Neural Networks via Layer-wise Optimal Brain Surgeon](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07565)

This repo contains:

1. Experiment codes for MNIST using lenet300-100:

    This is a toy code for L-OBS, you can know how L-OBS is implemented using lenet300-100 as an examples.
    
    How to use it:
    
    Just run lenet300-100/LOBS.py to prune lenet300-100

2. A utility code folder, which provides APIs for any network model and dataset. It is under maintain.
